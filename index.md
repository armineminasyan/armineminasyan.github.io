# About me

I am a **Data Analyst** focusing on online marketplaces.
My educational and professional background equips me with strong **analytical skills** to add value to online products across all platforms.
I love to take end-to-end **ownership** of new analytics products, working with non-technical stakeholders, data analysts, and engineers to deliver high-impact analytics products that measurably impact the company's bottom line.
I enjoy simplifying complex technical findings and offering **practical insights** to all team members.
My communication style aims to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring that data-driven decisions are clear and actionable.

# Resources

These are small repositories that I created and you might find useful.

1. **A powerful regression model for the Ames Housing dataset** ([Python Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/armineminasyan/ames-regression)).
The Ames Housing is an updated version of a classical regression dataset.
Given some *dirty* real-life data, we build a regression model to predict the closing selling prices of homes, based on their characteristics.
We use state-of-the-art models for tabular data, including CatBoost and XGDBoost tree-based models, and we stack them for increased accuracy. 
2. **Data Analyst interview test by the Wikimedia Foundation** ([Python Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/armineminasyan/wikimedia-test)).
This is a realistic data exploration and analysis task for an entry-level position.
You can explore a notebook with a thorough analysis, another one with insights relevant for data analysts and engineers, and a third one with an *executive summary* for management.
3. **Using the Google Maps Directions API with Excel and VBA** ([Spreadsheet and VBA Code](https://github.com/armineminasyan/vba-gmaps-directions)).
Visual Basic for Applications code to retrieve driving distances between all pair of locations by address.
The list of addresses is in a spreadsheet.
You need a Google Maps API token to use the code.
4. **Discovering energy consumption patterns of residential and commercial users** ([Python Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/armineminasyan/energy-consumption-clustering)).
A classical task in unsupervised machine learning, using clustering and pattern mining.
The dataset contains real-life enery consumption measurements of thousands of US buildings.
